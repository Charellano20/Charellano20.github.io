    <p><strong>Today was another day of ACS. This time around, we had to create a second project in scratch.<br>
    Now, this second time felt different because it wasn't a big project this time and we had a few days to work on it, not like an entire quater.<br><br>
    I definitly tried a different aproach this time around when making my sencond scratch project.<br>
    I wanted to make it a lot simpler than my last one, which stressed me out when making it.<br>
    Having this in mind, i made my project and came up with a simple and fun project. This project is in the style of Star Wars, characters and music.<br><br>
    I did not try to code in a specific way, I just put the code I needed to make my little project and got a pretty good result, with little to no errors.<br>
    All-in-all, I chose to do something simpler than my maze just cuz of timing and also because this project could be anything, so simple was an option on the table.<br><br>
    So yea, another day of coding, another day of knowledge.<br>
    This is Christopher Arellano saying Poyo poyo (goodbye). Note: I don't know if poyo poyo does mean goodbye, I just put this to represent Kirby.<br><br>

    <p><strong>Today was our second day of ACS, or first day for Computer Science language.<br> 
    Today we watched a lecture from a a person from Harvard where he talked about CS50X.<br><br>
    The lecture was pretty great, a little boring cause it's a lecture, but very intriguing.<br> 
    We learned a little bit about the decimal and binary code and how the decimal code, our regular 1-9 numbers, can be converted into binary code. This, for me, was very intriguing.<br><br>
    Right now, I understand what has been taught/said. I don't understand that I'm an expert already, I just understand, the usual I get understand.<br>
    The picture that was shown today in class, of a piece of pie and a computer part, probably mean that a computer is like pie.<br>
    Each part is like a slice of pie, but once there are all together, they make a delicous, and entire, pie, and in this case a useful computer.<br><br>
    Well, here is another blog entry ready for showing, until next time. This is Chris saying, "Hasta La Vista."

<p><strong>Today was the first day of Accelerated Computer Science elective course. I was pretty excited when I walked into the room of learning, learn coding to be more specific.<br><br>
I am writing this blog for 2 reason. One is because my teacher, the awesome Captain/Mr. Yoho, told us to do this so we can get used to writing day by day blog entries to remind us of the work we did. The second reason is because I want to learn the experience of write day by day entries, whether blog or daries.<br><br>
What I hope to gain out of this is just to remember moments in high school, since I kind of have a bad memory, and the skill of day by day writing.<br><br>
The elective I am taking, Accelerated Computer Science, is about coding and using these coding skills to solve real world problems, but this class teaches us more than just simple coding. I took this class because of two reason. Firstly because my school required that I changed electives and secondly because I wanted to learn more about coding than I might not learn this year in computer science.<br><br>
What I hope to get out of this class is more advanced coding skills and/or strategies that will help me later on in school and/or life.<br><br>This is Chris signing out.</strong>

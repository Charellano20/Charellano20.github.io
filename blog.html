    <p><strong>The revolution has begun. Well not revolution, but more like the truth is out. The cat is out of the bag, the pain is out there. I can go on, but I won't.<br>
    So, today in ACS, one of our classmate and friend, who the rest of us owe her big time for what she did, told Mr.Yoho of how we feel of CS50x.<br>
    Now before I go on, I'm just gonna say the name of this brave soul, so thanks Amelia. Now, today's blog post is about how I feel of CS50x and ACS as a whole.<br>
    Well, I love the coding experience, but not the project and course experience. What do I mean by this, well it means that I love learn the new code we get from the<br>
    videos, but don't like the projects and vid explanations. The videos don't explain the concept of the code that well, it kinda does, with the notes we can write,<br>
    but not in actual code. For example, bool is a true/false statement, the way I learned it is just that. The way the video explains it is more conplex and it just loses me<br>
    when it starts to get complecated. The projects are even worse because they literaly make us start fresh, with little, and almost not helpful, hints. They could have at<br>
    least given us some more hints that are useful or at least some starter code, other than the essential.<br><br>
    Well, the starter code wil likely never happen, but the more useful hints and/or example is still their in the air. I am literaly stressed out,tired and angry thanks to<br>
    this class, and you would not like me when I'm angry, and I'm not saying that just cause the hulk is one of the many superheroes I like. I literaly lose it when I'm<br>
    angry. Ask any of my friends of how I lose it, not 100% lucky, but yea. And If your saying I shoudl go to therpy, didn't work. The coding part is the only part of<br>
    this course that I ove, but everything else if of my dislike and hate side. So yea, ACS and code, 2 thumbs up, projects and videos are 4 thumbs down. Not to be<br>
    disrespectful to the people who make these and ;ead ot, but thats my opinion. Others may think other wise. I swaer, if I was a force wielder, I would have<br>
    turned to the dark side by now. Well then, thats it for this entry. This is Chris saying that hopefully your life is better or easier than mine, and if it is, ENJOY WHILE YOU CAN.

    <p><strong>Hello and welcome back freinds. I'm back. It's been a while since my last blog entry, but thats cause Mr.Yoho<br>
    hasn't assigned us blog entries in a while. I don't even know if he checks them, but im still typing. So, we got an article again, and its about encryption.<br><br>
    We have 3 questions to answer. The first one is "Do we have a right to keep our data on on the internet private?"<br>
    Although there might be a document say that we do, I think we don't because if if the document says so, we will not have our privacy because people and the government are just like that these days. There is never an privacy, except in our minds, for now.<br><br>
    The next question is "Is there ever a case when the government should be able to see a person's private data.<br>
    If yes, give an example of a situation where that would be the case. If no, give reasons why not." There is a case when the government should be able to see a person's privacy. When there a case, like a very dangerous case, the government has the right to look at everyone's internet privacy to find out info about this case.<br>
    I know what you minght be thinking, doesn't this go against your whole, it's not cool that the governent stalks us 24/7 without permmision, yes it does. Although, If what<br>
    they are doing is very important, then we would understand, but other than that, they are creeps.<br><br>
    Finaly, the last question is "Edward Snowden released government secrets that pointed to them spying on United States Citizens without their permission.<br>
    It is possible that Snowden is being charged with treason for these acts. By releasing these secrets, do you think that Snowden did the right thing?" First of all, Snowden<br>
    didn't get charged with treason. Now, I believe what he did was 1000% correct, yes 1000, because now everybody has another reason to hate the government. Thats how I<br>
    feel, but for thise who are not like me, they know a terrible truth now. So, Good guy, Snowden, bad guy, government.<br><br>
    Well, there you go folks, another entry done. And this time, it's about the the corrupted government and the hero, Snowden.<br><br>
    Well, may the force be with you.

    <p><strong>Here we go, another entry. This is starting to get fun. I love this idea. Thank you Mr.Yoho. Alright, lets get down to buisness.<br>
    So, today we got an article to read, which was given to us by the awesome Captain Yoho. This article is about Obama funding Compter Science in US schools, link for article will be posted below this entry.<br>
    This article isn't much, but what it's saying what Obama said, is a lot. So, here are my responses to the questions I've been given.<br><br>
    The first question ask how this decision, of Obama pledging $4b for CS, has very god benefits. Well, I say that the benefits of this decision are that students will be able to<br>
    have cool thing to work with in CS so that they can get ingaged and learn computer science, because most of Silicon Valley is full of jobs that envolve coding.<br><br>
    Now, the next question is "What negative side affects can arise?" While I personaly believe that there are no negative side effects, I can see some. These that I see only<br>
    happen if people get too carried away. One side effect is that the money will nit be in good use, meaning the plan will fail and what Obama wanted to heppen will not<br>
    happen.<br><br>
    The final question is "Do you endorse (support) this pledge?" I really endorse this pledge because we need more people to be in the field of coding, cuz most of america's<br>
    coders come from places away from america. Now, I'm not saying that non american coders is a bad thing, but what is bad is that we have most of the most advance tech<br>
    here and not many americans actually join that field. So, this is why this pledge is good and why I support it.<br><br>
    Well, it's time for m to once again sign off. So, this is Christopher Arellano, also know as Kirbykaze at school, and I'm just gonna say goodbye.<br><br>

    <p><strong>Today was another day of ACS. This time around, we had to create a second project in scratch.<br>
    Now, this second time felt different because it wasn't a big project this time and we had a few days to work on it, not like an entire quater.<br><br>
    I definitly tried a different aproach this time around when making my sencond scratch project.<br>
    I wanted to make it a lot simpler than my last one, which stressed me out when making it.<br>
    Having this in mind, i made my project and came up with a simple and fun project. This project is in the style of Star Wars, characters and music.<br><br>
    I did not try to code in a specific way, I just put the code I needed to make my little project and got a pretty good result, with little to no errors.<br>
    All-in-all, I chose to do something simpler than my maze just cuz of timing and also because this project could be anything, so simple was an option on the table.<br><br>
    So yea, another day of coding, another day of knowledge.<br>
    This is Christopher Arellano saying Poyo poyo (goodbye). Note: I don't know if poyo poyo does mean goodbye, I just put this to represent Kirby.<br><br>

    <p><strong>Today was our second day of ACS, or first day for Computer Science language.<br> 
    Today we watched a lecture from a a person from Harvard where he talked about CS50X.<br><br>
    The lecture was pretty great, a little boring cause it's a lecture, but very intriguing.<br> 
    We learned a little bit about the decimal and binary code and how the decimal code, our regular 1-9 numbers, can be converted into binary code. This, for me, was very intriguing.<br><br>
    Right now, I understand what has been taught/said. I don't understand that I'm an expert already, I just understand, the usual I get understand.<br>
    The picture that was shown today in class, of a piece of pie and a computer part, probably mean that a computer is like pie.<br>
    Each part is like a slice of pie, but once there are all together, they make a delicous, and entire, pie, and in this case a useful computer.<br><br>
    Well, here is another blog entry ready for showing, until next time. This is Chris saying, "Hasta La Vista."

<p><strong>Today was the first day of Accelerated Computer Science elective course. I was pretty excited when I walked into the room of learning, learn coding to be more specific.<br><br>
I am writing this blog for 2 reason. One is because my teacher, the awesome Captain/Mr. Yoho, told us to do this so we can get used to writing day by day blog entries to remind us of the work we did. The second reason is because I want to learn the experience of write day by day entries, whether blog or daries.<br><br>
What I hope to gain out of this is just to remember moments in high school, since I kind of have a bad memory, and the skill of day by day writing.<br><br>
The elective I am taking, Accelerated Computer Science, is about coding and using these coding skills to solve real world problems, but this class teaches us more than just simple coding. I took this class because of two reason. Firstly because my school required that I changed electives and secondly because I wanted to learn more about coding than I might not learn this year in computer science.<br><br>
What I hope to get out of this class is more advanced coding skills and/or strategies that will help me later on in school and/or life.<br><br>This is Chris signing out.</strong>
